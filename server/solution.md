# Analysis of `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` Error

## Problem Description

When running `npm run dev`, the application fails with the following error:

```
Error: Cannot find module '../generated/prisma'
Require stack:
- /home/apo/ankit/dev/projects/vr-automation/server/build/config/database.js
...
```

This indicates that the compiled JavaScript file `build/config/database.js` is attempting to import the Prisma client from a path that does not exist in the `build` directory.

## Root Cause

The `npx prisma generate` command successfully generates the Prisma client into `src/generated/prisma`. However, the TypeScript compiler (`npx tsc -b`) only compiles `.ts` files from `src` into `.js` files in the `build` directory. It does not automatically copy non-TypeScript files or directories like `src/generated` to the `build` output.

Consequently, when the Node.js application starts from the `build` directory, it cannot find the `generated/prisma` module because the `generated` directory was never copied from `src` to `build`. The relative import `../generated/prisma` from `build/config/database.js` resolves to `/home/apo/ankit/dev/projects/vr-automation/server/generated/prisma`, which is incorrect; it should be `/home/apo/ankit/dev/projects/vr-automation/server/build/generated/prisma`.

## Solution

The most straightforward solution is to explicitly copy the `src/generated` directory to `build/generated` as part of the build process. This ensures that the Prisma client is available in the correct location for the compiled application to find at runtime.

### Proposed Change

Modify the `build` script in `package.json` to include a command that copies the `src/generated` directory to `build/generated` after the TypeScript compilation is complete.

**Current `package.json` `build` script:**

```json
"build": "npx prisma generate && npx tsc -b"
```

**Proposed `package.json` `build` script:**

```json
"build": "npx prisma generate && npx tsc -b && cp -r src/generated build/"
```

This updated script will:
1.  Generate the Prisma client into `src/generated/prisma`.
2.  Compile all TypeScript files from `src` to `build`.
3.  Copy the `src/generated` directory (containing the Prisma client) into `build/generated`, making it accessible to the running application.

After this change, running `npm run dev` should successfully locate the Prisma client.
